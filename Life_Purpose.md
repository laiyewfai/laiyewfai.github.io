Life has no inherent purpose or meaning, except perhaps to perpetuate the species. But viewed as a journey of experiences, every moment becomes an opportunity for growth.

Success and failure are not opposing forces; they're two sides of the same coin. The true value of our experiences lies in the growth that emerges from them – where we evolve, thrive, and feel truly alive. This growth is the essence of living authentically.

Material possessions are mere props on this journey. They hold no inherent value, serving only as tools or backdrops for our self-discovery. Nothing truly belongs to us; people, events, and things exist solely for us to engage with and use – not own.

In reality, we possess nothing. We're granted temporary stewardship of everything – including our own lives – before it all fades away. Impermanence is the natural order of life.

Don't waste time mourning loss or clinging to people or possessions. This only breeds stress and makes it feel like they own us. Remember: ownership is fleeting, and loss is inevitable. When you accept this reality, you'll find no reason to grieve over what's lost. You'll face life's challenges with resilience, cherishing the right to use what you have while letting go of the notion of ownership.

Remember: Acquiring things may be accidental, but losing is a certainty – and embracing this truth can set you free.

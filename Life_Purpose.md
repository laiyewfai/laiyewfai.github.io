Life has no inherent purpose or meaning. From a biological perspective, its primary goal is survival and the perpetuation of the species.

However, life can also be viewed as a journey of experiences. Every activity—attending school, working, marrying—is an experience. In this context, success and failure are not opposites but different facets of the same journey. The true value of these experiences lies in growth—where one evolves, thrives, and feels truly alive. Growth, ultimately, is the essence of living.

If life is about experiences, material possessions are fleeting. They are merely tools or backdrops to our journey of self-discovery. Nothing truly belongs to us—people, events, and things exist for us to interact with and use, not to own.

In reality, we possess nothing; we are given only the temporary right to use everything, including our lives. Everything is transient, and all will eventually fade or perish.

Do not dwell in sorrow over loss, for impermanence is life’s natural order. Clinging to people or possessions breeds stress and, in time, makes it feel as though they own us. Remember: ownership is temporary, and loss is inevitable.

Once you embrace this truth, you’ll realize there is no need for sadness in losing someone or something. You’ll approach life’s challenges with resilience, cherishing the right to use what you have while letting go of the notion of ownership. Acquiring things may be accidental, but losing is inevitable—and accepting this reality can set you free.

Hello World!

If you are a programmer, you are probaly familiar with the first program written in a new language. This signifies two things:

1. a program which runs a line of code, successfully.
  
2. a program which gives a simple output to the interface.
  

This also correspond to what I want to achieve with this blog, which are

1. to execute my daily routines successfully.
  
2. to generate output(hopefully contributions) to the readers of the blog.
  

As a person who has worked in the IT line for many years, I find there are many similaries between Programming Codes and Living a life. They are

- Habits - automated batch jobs which get triggered
  
- Decision-making - If/Then/Else Conditional
  
- Continuous Improvement/Kaizen(改善） - Debugging to fix the issues
  

As I discovered, there are many concepts which can be cross-pollinated from one field to another. This is just one of the many examples.

This is also a journal for my journey, when I will record down what I learn, and what I try out, and what works and what doesn't. This blog also helps me to crystalize my thought process, and hopefully, help you (as a reader) to see things a little better.
